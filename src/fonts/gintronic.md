Gintronic’s gentle appearance makes it pleasant to constantly work with code. Most programming fonts appear too technical and are therefore tedious to read. Code operates very differently from ordinary text. As it’s usually not read from top to bottom, but rather piece by piece- back and forth, typefaces are required to have different performance abilities. Unlike many other programming fonts, Gintronic avoids a robotic look and helps information to breathe.
