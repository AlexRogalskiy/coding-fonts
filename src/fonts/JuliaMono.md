JuliaMono is a monospaced typeface designed for programming in the Julia
Programming Language and in other text editing environments that require a wide
range of specialist and technical Unicode characters. It was intended as a fun
experiment to be presented at the 2020 JuliaCon conference in Lisbon, Portugal
(which of course didnâ€™t physically happen in Lisbon, but online).
